# BitBot Racing Experience

I think we was going to start learing pygame on the half year meeting
in Programing and Modelling X, but it turned out to be this; BitBot
Racing Experience.

MultiBot I will use as a template and was what I handed inn as homework
while we leared how to program the microbit bit:bot using micropython.


I ended up on a team with to people that had barely learned python, but
we did manage to win the line follower contest.
I were in the lead in the end race, but some guy had figured out that
the BitBots actually drive faster backwards so he got a much better
time than me.
